### How to use the server

1. Copy and paste the above URL into your browser of choice. 
2. Create an account with Auth0 using an email and password. 
3. After creating an account or logging in, the site will display your JWT (JSON Web Token). 
4. Use this JWT in the Authorization Header to modify/view protected resources. You do not require a JWT in the Authorization Header if you are simply reading public resources. 

Please see Wiki for full documentation on data models, routes, and responses.

For testing, please use Postman and import the postman_collection.json and postman_environment.json
